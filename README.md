# Product-association-in-stores
 I create an algorithm that identifies opportunities for retail stores to benefit from 1-to-1 product association analysis.
 
a) Business Context

The data collected is granular transaction receipt data from a panel of independent grocery retailers.
The collected data is parsed from printed paper receipts and is subjected to both data
collection errors and store â€“ level nuances.

1. Clients would like to understand the types of stores that are present in the panel.

2. These store owners are interested to identify cross-selling opportunities in their stores via 1
to 1 product associations.

Identify opportunities via 1-1 product associations (if_bought_this_sales_item_id ->
likely_to_buy_this_sales_item_id), evaluate and rank the opportunities based on
relevant metrics.
